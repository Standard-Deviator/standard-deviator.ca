title = "Predictors of Problem Gambling Among Seniors in Ontario"
abstract = "Seniors are a particularly vulnerable group to gambling problems due to age-related cognitive decline, limited income, and other lifecycle events such as the loss of a partner. Using the Ontario Seniors Gambling data (N=2,103), an analysis was conducted to explore the effects of person-level, environmental, and person-level by environmental effects on gambling related outcomes. The primary analyses focused on a subset of meaningful predictors, demographic covariates, and gambling outcomes which were initially identified by the original analyses conducted by McCready et al. (2014). Logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors and possible interactions. Being married and formally employed were negative predictors of problem gambling, while specific avoidance motives, attitudes regarding the relative benefits versus harms of gambling, frequency of slot play, and spending more than $1000 annually all predicted problem gambling."
