abstract = """This present research aims to explore the effectiveness of two educational interventions whose purpose is to develop students' informal inferential reasoning and improve their ability to make accurate informal statistical inferences. A modified assessment tool developed by David Trumpower (2011) tests the efficacy of these interventions. One intervention is a series instructions that walks subjects through an example of day-to-day reasoning that uses informal statistical reasoning. The other is an interactive computer task that aims at getting students to have a deeper understanding of important data characteristics that are involved in statistical reasoning. Results and implications will be discussed."""
