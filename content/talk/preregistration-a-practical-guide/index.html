abstract: "This workshop begins by illustrating the main aspects of what preregistration can and cannot do for your research. Participants will be guided step-by-step through the preregistration process, both from a theoretical standpoint and a practical one. By introducing a few guiding principles and highlighting important considerations along the way, a worked example will be presented to illustrate the preregistration process. Participants are encouraged to work on their own preregistration in real time alongside the demonstration. By the end of the workshop, participants should have a good working knowledge of the practical aspects of the preregistration process. Participants will have the added benefit of creating a working-document which can be used to preregister their own research project."
