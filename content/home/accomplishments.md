  description = """Transparency and reproducibility of research methods and results are important hallmarks of high-quality research in areas from biomedical to social and physical sciences. In the last few years, many novel, often web-based tools and technologies have emerged that allow for a comprehensive representation of the scientific process that goes far beyond descriptions of research methods and results as found in traditional journal articles. These novel tools and technologies have the potential to revolutionise the way research methods and results are communicated and facilitate research collaborations and sharing of research data in an unprecedented manner. However, using these novel tools and technologies in a qualified and responsible manner requires knowledge and skills that are not normally taught in undergraduate or graduate degrees. To close this gap, we offer a five-day summer school to guide early career researchers (PhD students and postdocs) towards an open, transparent, and reproducible research workflow. These topics will be embedded in a more general curriculum on research ethics and stakeholder involvement"""
